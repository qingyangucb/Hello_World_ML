# Hello_World_ML
A mathematically simplified and elegant way to demonstrate the core idea of machine learning and display the process of neural network training.
In this website I have created two visualizations to show the process of training neurons which is something that nobody had done.
The first graph shows the target we are trying to train the neurons, and the second graph shows where the neurons currently are. And a table display will show the details on the values such as predictions and errors.
After training for some iterations you will see that the neurons will almost always point to the same direction as shown in the first graph.
I have built this website mostly by hard coding because this is a custom built calculation. I have used numpy for some matrix multiplication in python and used the javascript D3 library to get the result and display it on the website with plotly.
